Steps of Design Phase
	- 1) Requirements
	- 2) Design
	- 3) Implementation
	- 4) Maintenance
	- 5) Verification & Validation

Software Architecture
- organization of a system
- Set of design decisions you must make early on
	- hard to change
- decisions that you wish you could get early on
- Architecture vs Design
	- Design
		- module decision
		- easy to change
		- Scope-module
	- Architecture
		- System Decisions
		- Hard to Change
		- Scope-system

Importance of software Architecture
- good software architecture represents high internal quality of software, one that is not necessarily visible to customers

Common Architectural Styles
- Client Servers
	- Client-server
	- organized as set of services and associated servers, and clients that access and use the servers
	- Major components
		- print servers, file servers, email servers
		- Set of clients that call on the services offered
		- Network that allows the clients to access these services
	- Pros
		- it is centralized system that keeps all the data and its controls in one place
		- bring high level of scalability 
	- Cons
		- each service is a single point of failure so susceptible to denial of service attacks of server failures
	- Tier vs Layer
		- tier: physical separation
		- layer: logical separation
- N-tier
	- application processing, and database management in stored onto 2 or more processors
	- split into as many tiers as possible
		- client -> web app/processing -> database
			- above is example of 3 tier architecture
- Peer to Peer Architecture
	- systems are decentralized systems in which computations can be carried out by any node on the network
	- No clear distinction between clients and servers
		- Examples: Skype and BitTorrent
	- Appropriate in 2 circumstances
		- 1) computationally intensive and independent
		- 2) when system involves exchange of information between individual computers
	- Pros
		- highly redundant and hence both fault-tolerant and tolerant of nodes disconnecting from network
	- Cons
		- concerns about issues of security and trust, peers may behave in a malicious way.
- Blackboard/Shared Memory Architecture
	- data lies onto a single blackboard and divided into sub-components
	- Components
		- Knowledge sources: specialized modules with their own representation, for reading and writing
		- Control component: selects, configures and executes modules
		- Blackboard: structural global memory containing objects from the solution source
- Piper & Filter Architecture
	- Data centric style of architecture
	- data flows through the application
	- Advantages
		- easy to understand and supports transformation reuse
		- cam be implemented as either a sequential or concurrent system
		- Workflow style matches structure of many business processes
	- Disadvantages
		- format for data transfer has to be agreed upon between communicating transformations
		- system overhead increase due to multiple parsing and unparsing data with complex I/O formats
- Layered Architecture
	- application server contains the presentation layer, the application layer, and the domain layer
	- Database server is used for data storage
	- Pros
		- only need to understand the layers beneath the one we are on
		- higher level layers
	- Cons
		- layers cannot encapsulate
		- Coupling of code overtime
- Model-View Controller Pattern
	- follows layered approach
	- Model component: manages system data
	- View component: defines data is presented to the user
	- Controller component: manages UI(key presses and mouse clicks)
- MVVM(Model-View-VewModel) architecture
	- business logic is decoupled from UI 
	- make it particularly useful for developing applications
	- one of the recommended architecture patterns for developing android applications
- Implicit Invocation/Event-Driven Architecture
	- consumers listen to the events produced by others 
	- should be used when multiple subsystems must process the same events and real time processing 
- Microservices
	- Example: amazon web services
