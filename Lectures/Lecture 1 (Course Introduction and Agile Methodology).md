Goals
- standard principles and methodologies for better code design
	- more flexible and maintainable code

Course Overview
- Phases of Software Engineering
	- 1) planning out and deciding what the software is about 
	- 2) Designing the software and all its features
	- 3) Implementing the software using technology
	- 4) Testing the software to ensure it does what it is intended to do
		- also known as verification and validation
	- 5) maintenance and ensuring the software lasts a long time(~25 years)
- Use principles of OOP and leverage a class project 
- Roles of Industry
	- 1) Software Designer: details blueprint of software components and defining functions
	- 2) Software Architect: Ensures alignment with business and tech requirements
	- 3) Enterprise Architect: focuses on organization of IT's infrastructure

Course Logistics
- Project(majority of grade)
- Exams both group and individual(second most heavy)
- Setup stuff, Quizzes, surveys(rest of grade)

Project Details
- Done in groups of 5-6
- Tech Stack: Android Studio(using java)
- CATME survey
- Project Setup
	- Sprint 0.5: Team Setup, Version Control, Team Contract, Team availability
- Spring S1-S5
	- 2 weeks long each for implementation features and accomplish design components
	- Post sprint assessments via CATME

Team Formation Survey
- Team preferences groups of 3+ students
	- use the available group and do not create your own teams
- Teams will be assigned by 9/3 and spring 0.5 is 9/4

Extra Credit Opportunities
- Final Exam
- Sprint 5
- Quizizz Game Challenge in Lectures
- CIOS Challenge

Introduction to Agile
- Software Process Model
	- order activities
- Different Software Processes
	- 1) Waterfall
		- grandfather of design processes(Oldest design model)
		- Finish requirement firsts along with design then we go into implementation
			- fully complete one step before moving to next
		- Early error detection 
		- But no flexibility
	- 2) Agile
		- newest design model
		- design framework that constantly change
			- clients involved a lot within it
		- Arranged in Sprints
			- each sprint involves small chunks of the projects to do
		- High Flexibility
		- Difficult to plan and hard workflow coordination
