Visitor Pattern
- behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the object on which they operate
- used when we have to perform an option on multiple operations on a group of similar kinds of objects
- suggests you place new behavior into a separate class called visitor, instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes
- Visitor: the implementation that visits all the elements
- Concrete elements: the nodes/classes that need to be visited
