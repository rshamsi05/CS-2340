Cost of Change grows exponentially with time
- aims to to flatten the cost

Agile Methods
- focus on upfront code rather than waiting for documentation
- People over Process
- Iterative Approach deliver working SW quickly, evolve it quickly
- Customer involvement
- Expectations that requirements will change
- Simplicity- not inadequacy

Agile now considered a classification
- several discrete methodologies conform to the values and principles of Agile

Agile Specific Methods
- XP
	- one of the popular Agile approaches to Software Development
	- XP is a lightweight methodology for small to medium sized teams developing software in the face of vague or rapidly changing requirements
	- lightweight
	- Humanistic
	- Discipline
	- Always changing constantly
	- Values and Principles(Incremental Planning)
		- Communication(small teams)
		- Simplicity
			- no duplicate functionality
			- Fewest possible classes and methods(less coupling)
			- Refactoring
				- modular methods: each class responsible for one thing
		- Feedback(quick feedbacks with small releases)
			- sense of victory over quick feedbacks
		- Courage
	- Test-First Development
		- any program that doesn't have automatic test doesn't exist
		- Develop unit tests for each piece of functionality before implementing the functionality
		- Immediate feedback on implementation
	- Pair Programming
		- All production code with 2 people on 1 computer
		- Different roles - Programming -> strategizing
		- Studies suggest development productivity with pair programming is similar to that of 2 people working independently
	- Continuous Integration
		- Integrate and test every few hours or everyday
		- No Integration nightmare
	- On-site Customer
		- actual member of the team
			- sits with the team
			- brings requirements
		- System should be worth involving 1 customer at all times
	- Testing Strategies
		- 1) Unit Tests
			- test every meaningful feature
			- Special cases
			- may include refactoring
		- 2) System tests
			- test to see if everything works overall
- Scrum
	- Scrum Actors
		- Product Owner/Customer
			- expresses backlog items and order them by value
		- Team
			- responsible for deliverability
		- Scrum Master
			- manager of the team and check on team updates
	- High Level Process
		- Living list of requirements -> Backlog items to be completed next sprint -> 
		- Daily Scrum
			- when: daily
			- What: each team member answers 3 questions
			- Who: dev team, scrum master
			- How long: 15 minutes
		- doesn't dictate which SE practices developers should use
		- Iteration Span: scrum lasts about 3 weeks
		- Changes in iteration plan: cannot be changed after it was accepted
- This course uses a hybrid between Scrum and XP
