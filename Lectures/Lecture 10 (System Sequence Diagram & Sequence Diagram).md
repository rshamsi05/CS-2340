- System Sequence Diagram
	- Interaction diagram that models how actors and the system collaborate
	- Typically capture the behavior of a single use case
	- System viewed as black box
		- internal objects not shown
	- Emphasis on events that cross boundary from actors to systems
	- Why is it important?
		- design the software to handle the external input events
	- How to draw
		- Describe only one scenario from use case diagram
			- one use case per SSD
		- Think of the order of interactions of actor with system
		- Each interaction can be considered an event and shown as messages
		- Name events based on intentions, not on software implementation
			- authenticate vs enterPassword
			- selectItem vs clickItemInDropDownList
		- Start system message names with verbs
	- See slides for more complex example of the graph
	- Fragments
		- Loop
			- fragments used to represent repetitive sequence
			- condition is shown in brackets
			- an alternative version is to specify a guard or Boolean condition
		- Alternatives
			- combination fragment is used when a choice needs to be made between two or more message sequences.
			- Models "if then" logic
		- Option
		- References
			- manage the size of large sequence diagrams
- SD(Sequence Diagram)
	- models single scenario in the executing system
	- Only difference is that SD does not treat system as a black box
	- Activation bar
		- box placed on the lifeline to indicate that an object is active during an interaction
		- Length of the rectangle indicates the duration of the objects staying active for an action
	- Messages between objects
		- write message name and arguments above arrow
	- Synchronous Message
		- used when the sender waits for the receiver to process the message and return before carrying on with another
	- Asynchronous Message
		- when the message caller does not wait for the receiver to process the message and return before sending other messages to other objects within the system
	- Lifetime of Objects
		- creation: arrow with new written above it
		- deletion: an X at bottom of object's lifeline
			- Java doesn't explicitly delete objects; they fall out of scope and are garbage-collected.
		- fragments
			- same as SSD
